# ProtoSchool Nairobi

Welcome to the Nairobi chapter of [ProtoSchool](https://proto.school)!

We are a group of people passionate about the decentralized web and excited to learn, teach, and share ideas. Everyone is welcome!

## Organizers

For this chapter, we will be working with [Afrolynk Factory24](http://afrolynk.com/factory/) to provide a platform for young Africans to develop tech skills through bootcamps & training by offering mentoring sessions and workshops. We currently offer developers opportunities to learn IoT, Blockchain and want to increase that scope to the Decentralized Web specifically IPFS/IPLD/libPp2p/Multiformats.Factory24 aims at acting as a stimulus to young entrepreneurs in Africa through bootcamps & training by offering mentoring sessions and workshops but also create a platform for these entrepreneurs to be exposed in an environment to meet potential employers.
